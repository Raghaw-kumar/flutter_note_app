   ```

## Dependencies

- `provider`: ^6.0.5 - State management
- `flutter_secure_storage`: ^8.0.0 - Secure PIN storage
- `shared_preferences`: ^2.2.2 - Theme preference storage
- `sqflite`: ^2.3.2 - Local database for notes
- `path`: ^1.8.3 - Database path handling
- `uuid`: ^4.1.0 - Unique ID generation

## Security Features

- PIN is hashed using SHA-256 before storage

- PIN is stored in secure storage (Keychain for iOS, EncryptedSharedPreferences for Android)
- Session-based authentication
- No cloud sync to ensure data stays on device

## Architecture

The app follows a clean architecture pattern with:
- Models: Data structures
- Providers: State management
- Services: Business logic
- Screens: UI components

## Assumptions & Decisions

1. PIN Requirements:
   - Exactly 4 digits
   - Numeric only
   - No biometric authentication (for simplicity)

2. Data Storage:
   - Local storage only for privacy
   - SQLite for notes
   - Secure storage for PIN

3. User Experience:
   - Grid layout for better note overview
   - Dark mode support
   - Relative timestamps for better readability
